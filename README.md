### VIRTUAL ART GALLERY üñºÔ∏è

This is a page for the appreciation of Baroque art and display of the most important paintings of this style, with special effects created by React. Take a look:

### Features

I used React, version @18.2.0, for creating effects. In the timeline section, there's a content reveal effect using the page's height. <br/>
For the dropdown menu, I created a click interaction that adds or removes classes for animation to work. In the paintings section, it's possible to search for a name, painter, or year of the artwork using the search bar. <br/>
About the design, I created the prototype of the page using Figma, and all images went through squoosh.app so they wouldn't weigh down the page.
