### üñºÔ∏è VIRTUAL ART GALLERY 

This is a webpage for appreciation of Baroque art and display of the most important paintings of <br/>
this style, with special effects created by React, version @18.2.0. Take a look:

See the gallery here -> https://baroque-gallery.vercel.app

### Features

- React for creating effects. In the timeline section, there's a content reveal effect using the page's inner height. <br/>
- For the dropdown menu, I created a click interaction that adds or removes classes for animation to work. <br/>
- In the paintings section, it's possible to search for a name, painter, or year of the artwork using the search bar. <br/>
- I created the prototype using Figma, and all images went through squoosh.app, to not weigh down the page.
